1. Check in the Imakefile if all LIBS are ok for your system.
2. `configure`
3. `make` (Send me the output if this fails)
4. copy wsclock to /usr/X11/bin/
5. copy everything in the themes directory to either
   /usr/local/share/wsclock/ or /usr/share/wsclock/

   For testing, you can start them from the themes directory or
   give an absolute path.
