Workspace for DEBIAN
=======================

This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of Workspace, yet
another window manager, written mostly from scratch by Alfredo Kojima
in an attempt to provide as much of the useful OpenStep functionality
as possible under X11.  It is the natural step after AfterStep.

There are some changes in the paths, added support for Debian menu
system, improved user configuration (from the sysadmin point of view).
 
To run Workspace put this at the end of ~/.xsession:

exec /usr/bin/workspace

and remove other exec lines if present.  I have done my best to
overcome certain glitches and gotchas regarding Workspace
installation. /usr/bin/workspace is a shell script that tries to
make sure things are properly set up.  Take a look at it to see what's
going on.  Please read workspace(1x).


Other sources for documentation
-------------------------------

* The Workspace web site
  http://www.workspace.org/

  You can find all sorts of information here. It's kept very up to
  date.

* The Workspace manual written by Alfredo Kojima
  ftp://ftp.workspace.org/pub/workspace/docs/

  Please note the manual documents version 0.10.x of Workspace, and
  many features/changes have occured since then.  To find out what has
  changed, please read file:/usr/share/doc/workspace/NEWS.gz and
  file:/usr/share/doc/workspace/changelog.gz.  A new version of this manual is
  being developed.  If you want to contribute to the manual please
  contact wm-user@workspace.info

* The Workspace mailing list
  http://www.workspace.org/lists.php

  There's a Workspace mailing list.  There you can ask questions about
  Workspace and *related* applications (s/n is _way_ low nowadays
  due to unrelated discussions).

  Please read the archives before asking!

* The Workspace FAQ
  http://www.dpo.uab.edu/~grapeape/wmfaq.html

  This is NOT file:/usr/share/doc/workspace/FAQ.gz, but another document.
  It contains information about several aspects of Workspace that are
  not covered on the FAQ included alongside with this Readme.

* The Workspace Configuration documents
  ftp://ftp.workspace.info/pub/workspace/docs/Workspace-*-Config.txt.gz

  This documents the files found on ~/.workspace/Defaults/. It's kept as
  up to date as possible.

As a sidenote, I can't package these files with workspace because they
don't have a copyright statement that permits redistribution.


IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 0.6.3 or earlier
------------------------------------------

  * The directory name has changed form gnustep to .workspace
  * The format of the style files and Workspace file has
    changed.

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 0.14.1 or earlier (but newer than 0.6.3)
------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The Fiend has been renamed to Clip (in order to avoid hurting
    certain people's feelings... does that ring a bell or
    what?!?).  Look up "Fiend" in the dictionary... therefore, every
    keyword on Defaults/Workspace that says "Fiend" has to be
    replaced by "Clip".  The installation package tries to fix this
    globally, i.e, both in the system wide files and the user's files.
  * The ~/.workspace/Library/Workspace/Style directory is no longer
    called that, but "Styles" instead.  Update accordingly.  The wrapper
    script tries to be smart about this...

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 0.15.0 or earlier
-------------------------------------------

  * WindowPlaceOrigin syntax changed. The old was:
      WindowPlaceOrigin = "64, 64"
    The new one is:
      WindowPlaceOrigin = (64, 64)
    The installation package also fixes this.

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 0.17.3 or earlier
-------------------------------------------

  * Please note there's a new Icons directory under ~/.workspace/Library,
    and a new key IconPath. Read the section on paths.

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 0.17.5 or earlier
-------------------------------------------

  * Pandora's Box has been opened: Beware that some features of recent
    releases may not be compatible with those of 0.17.5; PLEASE read
    the NEWS file and the ChangeLog.  If you don't have problems
    upgrading, consider it a gift from the gods.  PLEASE NOTE: WPrefs
    is a work in progress.  SAVE YOUR CONFIGURATION. READ THE READMEs.
  * Please note that WPrefs' Menu Guru REQUIERES a menu in "Property
    List" format to work properly.  It's very likely that you have an
    old format menu.  There's a script called wm-oldmenu2new alongside
    this file that converts your menu to the new format.  It's a hack,
    it won't be installed anywhere else.


Debian specific notes
---------------------

Debian prepackaged version of Workspace will search
~/.workspace/Library/Workspace and /usr/share/Workspace (in that order)
for its configuration files. It will read defaults from files in
~/.workspace/Defaults and /etc/.workspace/Defaults. The files in the
Workspace directories have cpp-like format and are preprocessed by
Workspace. It will read both Workspace directories searching for
#included files.

Workspace makes a (little) difference between Pixmaps and Icons, and
there are two configurable options for setting the paths Workspace
would search Pixmaps and Icons in, namely, PixmapPath and
IconPath. The compiled in defaults are:

  PixmapPath = (
    "~/.workspace/Library/Workspace/Pixmaps",
    "~/.workspace/Library/Workspace/Backgrounds",
    "/usr/local/share/Workspace/Pixmaps",
    "/usr/local/share/Workspace/Backgrounds",
    "/usr/share/Workspace/Backgrounds",
    "/usr/share/Workspace/Pixmaps",
    "/usr/local/share/pixmaps",
    "/usr/share/pixmaps",
  );

  IconPath = (
    "~/.workspace/Library/Icons",
    "/usr/local/share/Workspace/Icons",
    "/usr/share/Workspace/Icons",
    "/usr/local/share/icons",
    "/usr/share/icons",
  );

Please note that the internal default doesn't include the "Pixmaps"
paths anymore, but you are free to modify your Workspace file in any
way you see fit.

Other Workspace packages should put pixmaps in
/usr/share/Workspace/Pixmaps and icons in
/usr/share/Workspace/Icons, ONLY.

The structure Workspace tries to use is like this:

.workspace
  +.AppInfo
  +Defaults
  +Library
     +Workspace
        + Backgrounds [*]
        + IconSets [*]
        + Pixmaps
        + Sounds
        + Styles [*]
        + Themes [*]
     +Icons

Please note Icons are not considered Workspace-only resources.

[*] these directories are OPEN_MENU'ed WITH the right
application. That means you can put the *file* "Great Debian Theme" on
Themes, it will show up in the menu, and will be opened using
setstyle, which installs it, i.e., sets that theme as the current
theme.

If you don't like the arrangement of the Appearance menu, you can put
a file "appearance.menu" in ~/.workspace/Library/Workspace, and it will
override the default one. Look at /etc/.workspace/Defaults/appearance.menu
for an example.

Shortcuts
---------

Thanks to a suggestion, there's support for Shortcuts.  If you want to
have Shift F1 launch an XTerm, you can:

$ cp /usr/lib/menu/xterm /etc/menu
$ sensible-editor /etc/menu/xterm

add:

        shortcut=Shift+F1

and run update-menus.

Sound Support
-------------

This version of Workspace is compiled with sound support. The sound
server is available as a separate package, but may not be in sync with
the current release.

Changing the menus (or "WPrefs segfaults when I click the cute menu icon")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I have this urge to say that it doesn't segfault for
me.  It gives me a nice warning about being unable to use my current
menu.

The problem is that workspace now is capable of using a new type of menu,
namely a PropList menu.  It looks something like this:

(
  Applications,
  (Debian, OPEN_MENU, menu.hook),
  (
    WorkSpace,
    (Appearance, OPEN_MENU, appearance.menu),
    (Workspaces, WORKSPACE_MENU),
    ("Arrange Icons", ARRANGE_ICONS),
    ("Hide Others", HIDE_OTHERS),
    ("Show All Windows", SHOW_ALL),
    ("Clear Session", CLEAR_SESSION),
    ("Save Session", EXEC, "")
  ),
  (About..., INFO_PANEL),
  (Exit, SHUTDOWN)
)

That cute looking menu button (let's call it by its name: the Menu
Guru) in WPrefs expects to find a menu in this format.  I considered
changing the menu-method to something that spits out a menu in this
format (it's quite easy) but there's a little tiny problem: see that
line that reads "OPEN_MENU" in the example above... well, it happens
that appearance.menu has to be in the old format.  That means that if
I make the menu method produce a new style menu, that menu has to be
the root menu.  And that is not a good idea (the reason is left as an
exercise to the reader, take into account the people that aren't using
menu.hook as the root menu in the first place).

Still want to use WPrefs to edit you menu? Cut and paste the example
above into ~/.workspace/Defaults/WMRootMenu, start WPrefs, click the Menu
Guru (the 9th icon, left to right).  Now go read the docs.  That's the
reason they are there.
