Description: NeXTSTEP-like window manager for X
 Written by Alfredo Kojima almost from scratch, resembles the NeXTStep look
 very closely, and it is now an official GNU project. Workspace is not
 overloaded with features, and it is easier to configure than most other window
 managers. Its final goal is to produce a window manager that doesn't require
 editing of configuration files. Workspace is fast and doesn't require tons
 of memory to run.

Description: Workspace's own widget set
 WINGs Is Not .workspace (WINGs) is a small widget set with the NeXTSTEP
 look and feel. Its API is inspired in OpenSTEP and its
 implementation borrows some ideas from Tk. It has a reasonable set of
 widgets, sufficient for building small applications like a CDPlayer
 or hacking something like rxvt. It is used for basic widgets in
 the Workspace window manager.

Description: Debugging symbols for Workspace packages
 Written by Alfredo Kojima almost from scratch, resembles the NeXTStep look
 very closely, and it is now an official GNU project. Workspace is not
 overloaded with features, and it is easier to configure than most other window
 managers. Its final goal is to produce a window manager that doesn't require

 This package contains debugging symbols for Workspace and its core
 libraries (libWINGs, libWutils, libwraster).
