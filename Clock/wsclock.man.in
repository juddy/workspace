.SH NAME
.PP
.BR wsclock :
a dockable clock for the Workspace window manager
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
\fBwsclock\fP [{\-12|\-24|\-year}] [\-noblink] [\-exe \fIprogram\fP]
[\-led \fIcolor\fP] [\-monthxpm \fIfilename\fP] [\-weekdayxpm

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B Wmclock
is an applet which displays the date and time in a dockable tile in the
same style as the clock from the NEXTSTEP(tm) operating system.
.B Wmclock
is specially designed for the Workspace window manager, by Alfredo
Kojima, and features multiple language support, twenty-four-hour and
twelve-hour (am/pm) time display, and, optionally, can run a
user-specified program on a mouse click.
.B Wmclock
is derived from
.BR asclock ,
a similar clock for the AfterStep window manager.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-12\fR or \fB\-24\fR
Display the time in either twelve-hour format (with am/pm) or
twenty-four-hour format.  Defaults to twenty-four-hour display.
.TP
\fB\-year\fR
Display the current year in the LED display instead of the time.
.TP
\fB\-noblink\fR
The separator between the hours and minutes in the time display blinks
by default.  This option turns off the blinking and displays a steadily
lit separator instead.
.TP
\fB\-exe\fR \fIcommand\fR
Run
.I command
in the background when a mouse button is pressed over
.BR wsclock .
See below for details.
.TP
\fB\-led\fR \fIcolor\fR
Use
.I color
as the foreground color of the LED display.
.I Color
may be either a named color from the rgb.txt database (for example,
`red' or `chartreuse') or a numeric color specification in any of the usual
X11 formats (for example, `#ff0000' or `rgb:7f/ff/00').  See the
.BR X (1)
man page for more information.
.TP
\fB\-monthxpm\fR \fIfilename\fR
Get month abbreviations from
.IR filename ,
which is expected to be in the XPM format.  See below for details.
.TP
\fB\-weekdayxpm\fR \fIfilename\fR
Get weekday abbreviations from
.IR filename ,
which is expected to be in the XPM format.  See below for details.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH INVOCATION AND EXAMPLES
.PP
The simplest way to start
.B wsclock
is:
.PP
.RS
.TQ
wsclock
.RE
.PP
.B Wmclock
displays in its own appicon, which you can place in Workspace's dock
by holding down the [Alt] or [Meta] key and dragging
.B wsclock
to the dock with the primary mouse button (usually the left one).
.PP
For a more complicated example:
.PP
.RS
.TQ
wsclock \-12 \-led gold \-exe /usr/GNUstep/Apps/WPrefs.app/WPrefs
.RE
.PP
This displays 12-hour time in an amber-colored LED display, and starts
Workspace's preferences utility when you click on
.BR wsclock .
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DETAILS
.SS Running Commands
.PP
When you use
.B wsclock
with the 
.B \-exe
option,
.B wsclock
will run the command you specify whenever you press a mouse button
while the mouse cursor is over
.BR wsclock .
.B Wmclock
uses the
.BR system (3)
function from the C library (and ultimately 
.BR /bin/sh )
to run the command; hence, the command must be in Bourne-shell syntax.
.SS Using Alternate Month and Weekday Abbreviations
.PP
You can use the
.B \-monthxpm
and
.B \-weekdayxpm
options to convince
.B wsclock
to display month and day-of-week abbreviations in a language besides
the one it was compiled with, or to display them in a language that
.B wsclock
does not yet support.  The files you specify must be in the XPM format,
and they must follow the same strict size and placement as the month
and weekday XPMs that come in the
.B wsclock
source package.  Each weekday abbreviation must be 21 pixels wide and 6
pixels high; each month abbreviation must be 22 pixels wide and 6
pixels high.  The month abbreviations must be arranged vertically,
beginning with January at the top and continuing down to December at
the bottom.  The weekday abbreviations must also be arranged
vertically, beginning with Monday at the top and continuing to Sunday
at the bottom.
.SS Obsolete Options
.PP
In order to maintain command-line compatibility (mostly) with
.BR asclock ,
.B wsclock
accepts a few options on the command line without complaining, even
though they don't have any effect.  The options which
.B wsclock
accepts in this manner are
.B \-shape
and
.BR \-iconic .
Some dockable versions of
.B asclock
required one or both of these options to become properly dockable.
However, Since
.B wsclock
is designed for Workspace's dock, it already displays in a shaped
window in its own dockable appicon.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------
.SH BUGS
.PP
.B Wmclock
shouldn't run a command on a single click; should use a double click
instead.
.PP
.B Wmclock
should use Alfredo Kojima's libdockapp library instead of inventing its
own wheel.
