Introduction
------------

These notes are meant to help you in the process of making and submitting
patches to the git repository of workspace-crm.

It assumes you have 'git' correctly installed and you have set the most
basic configuration options via 'git config'. See the end of this file
for an example .gitconfig.

To clone the workspace-crm repository you can do:

git clone git://repo.or.cz/workspace-crm.git

__________________________
Producing a patch with git
--------------------------

You have the workspace source and you want to write a patch in order to fix
a bug or improve something. A possible workflow is the following.

# Optional: Create a new branch (to be safe in case you screw up)
git checkout -b fixbug

Now you fix the bug...

# Check what you did, review etc
git diff

# if it looks good, commit your changes
git commit -a

Git will open the editor set in your .gitconfig and you'll have to write a
commit message. Writing a good message is as important as the source code
modifications you've just made! See "Writing the commit log" for advice.

# Prepare the patch to submit to the mailing-list.
# (use HEAD~2 if you want patches for the last 2 commits etc)
git format-patch HEAD~1

______________________
Writing the commit log
----------------------

You had a motivation to write your patch, you studied the sources and you
found a way to do what you wanted to do. This whole process takes time and
other people will not want to invest that time to rediscover what you've
already found.

So the main reason for the commit message is to explain to other people what
you did, _why_ and _how_. And you must assume that the person you must explain
these things to will not be as familiar with the code you just modified as you
are right after writing the patch -- and that includes yourself in a year or
so. Be verbose in all the steps below.

The good commit log will start with the reason for writing the patch.

For example, if you use workspace in some way and you expect that X happens but
you get Y, you should say that very clearly. Sometimes that's enough for other
more experienced people to know how to solve your issue. They will be able to
judge your patch better if they know what you wanted to do -- sometimes there
can be a better way to fix it.

Then you should explain why the workspace source leads to Y and not to X.

Technicall stuff can be expected at this point, e.g. "upon doing xyz in function
foobar(), workspace sets the variable foo to 'y' instead of setting it to 'x', and
that will lead to blabla happening in function foobar_squared()...".

And finally you explain how you fixed it.

"You have to set foo to 'x', because then when the function foobar_squared() is
called it will do X instead of Y because..."

At this point other people will have a clear understanding of what you did with
minimal effort. And that leads to better patch reviews.

Furthermore, the above reasons should also tell you that you must not do
more than one thing in the same patch. Again:

       "Each patch must do one thing and one thing only."

If your patch does too much of unrelated stuff, it makes reviewing a nightmare
and long-term mantainance much worse (think about a patch which introduces a
regression in the middle of many other nice improvements, and now you have to
get rid of the regression without removing the improvements -- 'git revert'
will not help you here).

If you find yourself having troubles to write what you did in the commit
message, perhaps you did too much. In this case you should split your patch
into smaller unrelated pieces and produce a patch series. Unfortunately it's
more work for you, but it's much better for workspace.

_____________________________________
Sending the patch to the mailing list
-------------------------------------

Send your patches to:

workspace-dev@lists.workspace.org

Please do not send patches to any individual developer unless you have a very
good reason to avoid more people being able to comment (and improve) on your
patches.

Sending the patch _properly_ is not as trivial as you might think. Some mail
clients convert TABs to spaces or word wrap long lines automatically, which
will result in your patch being rejected as it will not apply with 'git apply'.

Ideally your patch should contain a very good commit message that explains
why you wrote the patch in the first place (see "Writing the commit log").
In this case you can simply send the file(s) created in the 'git format-patch'
step above as the sole content of your email to the mailing list. All your
reasons and explanations will be in the commit log, and your email will look
like:

**********************************
From: someone@someplace
Subject: [PATCH] Fix something

The commit message.

The diff itself.

Read the file email-clients.txt in the topdir of the workspace-crm repository
to be adviced on how to tweak your email client to avoid common pitfalls.
